# Salifort-Motors

## Overview

Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone project. Built around the fictional french Salifort-Motors organisation, this repository utilises skills taught through Google 's course such as project proposals, EDA, model building, statistical testing, PACE planning and stakeholder summaries to analyse and predict employee retention.

### About the company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifort’s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.        


### Scenario

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. **(Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go)**. Salifort’s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 

If Salifort could **predict whether an employee will leave the company**, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. Therefore, **discover what’s likely to make the employee leave the company.**

As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover.  

Next, the leadership team asks you to analyze the survey data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest you design a model that **predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points.** A good model will help the company **increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees**, and save money and time training new employees. 

As a specialist in data analysis, the leadership team leaves it up to you to choose an approach for building the most effective model to predict employee departure. For example, you could build and evaluate a statistical model such as logistic regression. Or, you could build and evaluate machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Or, you could choose to deploy both statistical and machine learning models. 

For any approach, you’ll need to analyze the key factors driving employee turnover, build an effective model, and share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team. 

### Your business case
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful. 

### Deliverables
For this deliverable, you are asked to choose a method to approach this data challenge based on your prior course work. 

- Select either a regression model or a tree-based machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
